# ME 482 - FYDP Squatter Spotter

Arduino (.ino) code that integrate ToF sensors in conjunction with L295N motor drivers in order to control a squat exercise spotting mechanism. 

Implementation consists of using the ToF sensor input in a feedback-based control system (follower) to track the user's motion and spot the user upon failure.
